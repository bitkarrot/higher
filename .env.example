# Team Domain is used to source nostr.json
# Team Domain is optional, if not set, team membership check will be skipped
# events won't be rejected by pubkeys if not part of the team
# Blossom uploads follow the same behavior: when TEAM_DOMAIN is empty,
# team membership checks are skipped (size limits still apply).

# Access Control via Master Key Derivation
# Provide EITHER RELAY_MNEMONIC (BIP39 phrase) OR RELAY_SEED_HEX (32-byte hex seed)
# If provided, the relay will treat any derived child pubkey (BIP32) as authorized for writes.
# Reads can optionally be restricted to derived authors only (see READS_RESTRICTED below).
# If neither is provided, derivation-based checks are skipped.
RELAY_MNEMONIC=""          # e.g., "abandon abandon ..."
RELAY_SEED_HEX=""          # e.g., "0123abcd..." (64 hex chars)
MAX_DERIVATION_INDEX=100    # search bound for child keys (default: 100)
READS_RESTRICTED=false      # when true, queries must specify authors derived from master

# Relay Kind Filtering
# Leave blank to allow all kinds, or specify comma-separated list of allowed kinds
# Examples:
#   ALLOWED_KINDS="" (allow all kinds)
#   ALLOWED_KINDS="0,1,5,10002,30311" (only allow specific kinds)
ALLOWED_KINDS=""

# Maximum file upload size in MB (default: 200)
